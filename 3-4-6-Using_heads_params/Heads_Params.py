# The defined params and headers are passed to the class method make_get_request. The class method takes in the three
# arguments:
#
# 1. a constructed address with the path
# 2. the parameters
# 3. the headers.

# OUTPUT:

# Date :  Wed, 16 Jun 2021 13:10:52 GMT
# Content-Type :  application/json
# Content-Length :  105
# Connection :  keep-alive
# Server :  gunicorn/19.9.0
# freeform :  Something is HERE
# Access-Control-Allow-Origin :  *
# Access-Control-Allow-Credentials :  true
# None
# b'{\n  "Content-Length": "105", \n  "Content-Type": "application/json", \n  "freeform": "Something is HERE"\n}\n'
# https://httpbin.org/response-headers?freeform=Something+is+HERE

# If you wanted multiple param and multiple headers, you could just expand param and headers further like this:

params = {'freeform': 'Something is HERE', 'test': 'test'}
headers = {'content-type': 'application/json', 'test': 'test'}
